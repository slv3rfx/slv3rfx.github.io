As I am still new in the world of cybersecurity and penetration testing, I want to document my progress on my learning. I will be starting with this write-up of the Lame machine on HackTheBox, showing my approach and thought process while pwning it.

First, I started with a typical nmap scan. Since nmapâ€™s ping packets seem to get blocked, I had to add the Pn switch to tell nmap to scan the ports regardless.

```console
$ nmap --open -sC -Pn -oA scans/nmap_initial {TARGET_IP}
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3
Host is up (0.050s latency).

```

According to the scan results, there are four ports open.

The ports are associated with the services FTP, SSH, and SMB. As it seems that anonymous login is enabled on FTP, I tried connecting to it. Unfortunately, I quickly found out that it was empty.

Next, I had a look at the shares exposed by SMB.

The _tmp_ share looked interesting so I connected to it. But I did not find anything of interest.

When I took another look at the output of the share listing, I noticed that Samba 3.0.20 is being used. Then, I searched the Internet for vulnerabilities for this particular version of Samba. I discovered that it has the CVE number [CVE-2007-2447](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-2447) as well as a [Metasploit module](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320) which gives us an immediate root shell.

Afterwards, I quickly started Metasploit and searched for Samba and set the necessary options.

> You still need to set the LHOST option to the IP address of your tun0 interface.
{: .prompt-info}

After running the exploit, you have access to a reverse shell as the root user.

You can find the two flags at /home/makis/user.txt and /root/root.txt, respectively.
