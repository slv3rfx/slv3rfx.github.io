    "content": "Jerry is an easy-rated Windows machine on HTB that can teach you some basics of proper enumeration, searching for exploits on the Internet, and brute-forcing valid credentials for protected pages.EnumerationLet’s start by enumerating the target with a standard nmap scan.$ nmap -oA scans/nmap_initial -Pn 10.10.10.95We can see that there is a web server running on port 8080. Let’s do another scan for this port with the default scripts and service detection.$ nmap -oA scans/nmap_scripts -sV -sC -p 8080 -Pn 10.10.10.95Through the http title, we find out that it’s an Apache Tomcat server with the version 7.0.88.When we try to visit the website, we are presented with Tomcat’s default page saying that it was installed successfully. There, we can see two buttons that look interesting: “Manager App” and “Host Manager”. But we need credentials for both of them.When searching for exploits for this version of Tomcat, we also come across this HackTricks article. It describes how we can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by uploading a malicious .war file. However, there is a catch: We first need to be able to access the Tomcat Web Application Manager. As we saw in the last step, we first have to find some valid credentials.Finding Valid CredentialsThere are several possible ways we can go about finding the credentials we need. You could search on the Internet for standard Tomcat usernames and passwords. When you do this, you will find lists, like this or this. Trying them one by one manually would be one option. Another option would be to write a script yourself in your preferred language, iterating over the list and testing the validity of each pair. You could also use a tool such as Hydra.However, in our case, there is also a Metasploit module available so we’ll use that.When we run this scanner, we will get one pair of valid credentials: tomcat:s3cretExploitationWith the newly acquired credentials, we can now exploit the above-mentioned RCE vulnerability. In order to do this, you could create your own .war file and upload it manually. The official write-up explains how you can do that.Since there is a Metasploit module available for this step as well, we will take the easy route.  Set the LHOST option to the IP address of your tun0 interfaceAfter we run this, we will get a Meterpreter shell on the target machine as the user JERRY.Both flags can be found in the C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\flags directory."

I will be starting with this write-up of the Lame machine on HackTheBox, showing my approach and thought process while pwning it.First, I started with a typical nmap scan.

As it seems that anonymous login is enabled on FTP, I tried connecting to it. Unfortunately, I quickly found out that it was empty.Next, I had a look at the shares exposed by SMB.The tmp share looked interesting so I connected to it. But I did not find anything of interest.When I took another look at the output of the share listing, I noticed that Samba 3.0.20 is being used. Then, I searched the Internet for vulnerabilities for this particular version of Samba. I discovered that it has the CVE number CVE-2007-2447 as well as a Metasploit module which gives us an immediate root shell.Afterwards, I quickly started Metasploit and searched for Samba and set the necessary options.  You still need to set the LHOST option to the IP address of your tun0 interface.After running the exploit, you have access to a reverse shell as the root user.You can find the two flags at /home/makis/user.txt and /root/root.txt, respectively."

    "content": "Filtering sequences, like lists, is a common task for developers. However, the code can become verbose and challenging to read, depending on the complexity of the filtering conditions. In this article, we’ll explore techniques Python offers to filter sequences effectively.Using For LoopThis technique can be applied to any programming language. It serves as a universal approach to sequence filtering.By following this method, you start with an empty sequence, iterate over the sequence you want to filter using a for loop, and add the items that meet your conditions to the newly created sequence. Here’s an example of filtering the even numbers from a list:numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]even_numbers = []for number in numbers:  if number % 2 == 0:    even_numbers.append(number)Using filter() FunctionPython provides a built-in function, filter(), specifically designed for filtering sequences. This function takes two arguments: a function that evaluates each item and the sequence to filter. The function should accept an item as an argument and return True or False based on a condition.Let’s use the previous example and implement it using the filter() function:def is_even(number):  return number % 2 == 0numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))It returns a filter object which can be cast to any other sequence object, like list or tuple.Instead of creating a separate function and passing a reference, you can also pass a lambda function:numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]even_numbers = list(filter(lambda number: number % 2 == 0, numbers))Using List ComprehensionList comprehension is a concise and powerful technique to create new lists by iterating over existing sequences or performing operations on their elements. It offers a compact and readable way to generate lists without the need for explicit loops. The basic syntax in Python is as follows:new_list = [expression for item in sequence if condition]Syntax Breakdown      new_list: This is the new list that will be created using the list comprehension. It is optional to assign the result to a variable.        expression: This is the expression or operation that will be performed on each item in the sequence to generate a new element for the new list.        item: This is a variable that represents each item in the sequence being iterated over.        sequence: This is the existing sequence, such as a list, string, or range, that is being iterated over.        if condition (optional): This is an optional condition that filters the elements based on a specified condition. Only the elements that satisfy the condition will be included in the new list.  Let’s apply list comprehension to the previous example:numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]even_numbers = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]Using Generator ExpressionsGenerator expressions are similar to list comprehensions, but instead of creating a new list, they generate a generator object. A generator object produces values on-the-fly as they are requested, avoiding the need to store them all in memory like a list.The syntax for a generator expression is similar to list comprehension, but it uses parentheses instead of square brackets:generator = (expression for item in sequence if condition)Here’s the previous example implemented using generator expressions:numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]even_numbers = (number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0)Considerations for Choosing the Right TechniqueEach technique has its advantages and drawbacks. Let’s go through them:For LoopA for loop provides flexibility and control but can be less concise. It allows custom conditions and operations. However, it might require more code and be slower, especially for large datasets.filter() FunctionThe filter() function is convenient for simple filtering based on a single condition. However, it creates a separate list of filtered elements in memory, which can be inefficient for large sequences. Additionally, filter() requires an additional function or lambda expression.List ComprehensionList comprehensions are compact and often faster than for loops or filter() because they optimize internal mechanisms for iterating over collections. They provide a compact way to filter and perform operations. However, they create a new list in memory as well, so memory usage may be a concern for large datasets.Generator ExpressionGenerator expressions are memory-efficient as they generate values on-the-fly without creating a separate list in memory. They are useful for large datasets or infinite sequences. Generator expressions are generally faster and more memory-efficient than list comprehensions, but they may not be suitable for random access or multiple iterations.To choose the appropriate method, consider your specific use case, data size, and operations performed. Balance readability, memory usage, and execution speed.ConclusionPython offers multiple ways to filter sequences in a concise and readable manner. In this article, we covered the following techniques:      Normal For Loop        filter() Function        List Comprehension        Generator Expression  When choosing a technique, consider the advantages and disadvantages for your requirements."
